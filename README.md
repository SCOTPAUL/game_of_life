Game of Life
============

A simple [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) in Rust. Can choose the live cells before starting.

## Controls

Move the cursor initially with `w, a, s, d`. Make a cell live with the spacebar.

To start the game, press `q`.

When the game is running, if there are no live cells it will end. Otherwise, press `q` to quit. And... that's all.
